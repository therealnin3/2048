## What I've learned and will improve in the future

During the development of this project, I have learned several key concepts in Unity, including:

- Creating animations to enhance the visual appeal of the game.
- Designing and implementing an interactive user interface (UI) for a seamless gaming experience.
- Understanding how game objects interact with each other through scripting.
- Implementing a menu flow to provide a smooth navigation experience for players.
- Exploring multithreading techniques to optimize performance and handle complex tasks.
- Adding an online leaderboard system to track and display high scores.

In the future, I plan to further improve these aspects and explore more advanced Unity features to enhance the gameplay and overall experience.
